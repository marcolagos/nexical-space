## Notes

## Papers

- Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David
  - This textbook offers a comprehensive introduction to the foundations of machine learning, including the advantages and challenges of different model architectures.
- Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun
  - This paper introduced ResNets, which utilize skip connections to train extremely deep networks. It discusses challenges like vanishing and exploding gradients and how they are mitigated.
- Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition by Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner
  - A seminal paper that discusses the application of convolutional networks (a type of deep network) to document recognition.
- Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks by Matthew D. Zeiler and Rob Fergus
  - This paper provides insights into what convolutional networks (a kind of deep network) learn and how they can be visualized.

## Textbooks

- Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
